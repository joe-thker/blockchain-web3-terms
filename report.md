## Professional Smart-Contract Security Audit Report

*(Template & detailed guidance)*

---

### 1. Executive Summary

> **Objective.** Assess the security, correctness, and upgrade resilience of the target Solidity contracts at commit **\<commit-hash>**.
> **Result.** 12 findings (2 Critical, 3 High, 4 Medium, 3 Low). No undisclosed back-doors or malicious logic detected. All critical issues were fixed and retested; no further exploitable paths remain.
> **Impact.** After remediation the contracts meet industry best-practice baselines (OpenZeppelin, SWC, OWASP B-09) and are prepared for main-net deployment subject to continuous monitoring.

### 6. Detailed Findings

*(Only top two shown here; replicate table for each finding.)*

#### F-01 Re-entrancy via `claimReward()` – **Critical**

| Item                 | Description                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Impact**           | Attacker drains reward pool ≈ 92 % TVL in one tx.                                                          |
| **Exploit scenario** | 1. Attacker stakes 1 wei. 2. Calls `claimReward()`; in callback, triggers second call before state update. |
| **Code refs**        | `Treasury.sol:128 – 147`                                                                                   |
| **Root cause**       | External call before `claimed[msg.sender] = true`.                                                         |
| **Fix**              | Adopt Checks-Effects-Interactions, added re-entrancy guard from OZ. Commit *d4996c2*.                      |
| **Retest**           | Fuzz harness w/ `vm.prank` confirmed no re-enter paths (10 M iterations).                                  |

#### F-02 Unbounded loop in `batchBurn()` – **Critical**

| Item       | Description                                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Impact** | DoS against all transfers; tx exceeds block gas limit when `holders.length > 4000`. |
| **Fix**    | Replaced with paginated burn (`start`,`end` params); added circuit-breaker.         |

### 7. Gas & Performance Optimizations

| Change                                                                 | Savings | Notes |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Replace `uint` with `uint256` in storage saves 200 gas/call (packed)   |         |       |
| Cache `IERC20 token = IERC20(_token)` locally (–13 gas/loop)           |         |       |
| Use custom errors instead of `require(string)` (≈ –21 bytes/byte-code) |         |       |
| Remove `SafeMath` on ≥ 0.8.0 compiler (auto-checked)                   |         |       |

Total estimated deployment savings: **-88 kGas** (≈ 0.006 ETH).

---

### 8. Upgradeability & Governance Review

* **Proxy admin secured** by 3-of-5 multisig; timelock enforced on `upgradeTo()` (48 h).
* **Storage-layout checks** added (`forge inspect --storage-layout`).
* **UUPS risk:** Self-destruct blocked via immutable UUID guard.
* **Diamond facets** aligned to EIP-2535; loupe diagnostics included in CI.

---

### 9. Test Coverage & CI/CD

* **Branches:** 95 % (Foundry `forge coverage`).
* **Negative tests:** 71 re-entrancy & overflow fuzz cases.
* **CI**: GitHub Actions matrix (Solidity 0.8.{20,23,25}).
* **CD**: Canary deploy to Sepolia; smoke tests run via Anvil fork.

---

### 10. Recommendations & Best Practices

1. **Continuous monitoring** – enable on-chain alerting (Forta or Tenderly).
2. **Bug-bounty** – launch prior to main-net upgrade; seed pool 2 % of token supply.
3. **Automated dependency updates** – Dependabot + semantic-release tags.
4. **Incident response plan** – define privileged pauser; rehearse timelock emergency flow.

---

### 11. Conclusion

All identified critical and high-severity issues were remediated and verified. The codebase now adheres to modern Solidity-security expectations. Deployment is recommended once governance multisig sign-off is complete and monitoring alarms are configured.

### 13. Disclaimers

The audit is a best-effort security review at a fixed snapshot in time. It does **not** guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities or suggest the contracts are future-proof against novel attack vectors. Deployments and upgrades remain at the sole risk of the project team.
