# blockchain
This repository is a comprehensive educational project that showcases a wide range of blockchain concepts and decentralized finance models through Solidity smart contracts. It includes examples covering fundamental blockchain data (such as block headers, block height, and block time), innovative trading mechanisms (like bid-ask spread and block trade), and advanced financial models (including yield curves, Black-Scholes, and bonding curves). Additionally, the project features implementations of alternative economic systems like blockchain mutual credit and various token standards (BEP-20, BEP-721, and a hypothetical BEP-95). Each contract is thoroughly commented and comes with deployment instructions for easy testing using Remix IDE. Overall, this repository serves as a practical resource for developers and enthusiasts looking to understand and experiment with blockchain technology and decentralized financial systems.
