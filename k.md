Here’s the quickest, clean-looking way to brand **that exact Markdown file** without breaking its structure.

---

### 1. Add a “cover-page” logo block **before** the first `<h2>` heading

Insert this right at the very top of the file, **above**
`## Professional Smart-Contract Security Audit Report`.

```markdown
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/logo.png" alt="Your-Org Security Logo" width="180"/>
</p>
```

**Why here?**

* It behaves like a title-page logo in a PDF export.
* It keeps the rest of your heading hierarchy intact.

---

### 2. (Optional) Lightweight header logo on every page

If your Markdown will be converted to a PDF/Word doc that supports repeating headers, add a small monochrome version just after the cover block:

```markdown
<header>
  <img src="assets/logo-lite.png" alt="Logo" width="60" style="float:left;margin:4px 8px 0 0"/>
</header>
```

Most Markdown-to-PDF engines (Pandoc, Marked 2) respect simple `<header>` tags; Word and Google Docs will ignore them, so you can add their headers later during formatting.

---

### 3. (Optional) Confidential footer with logo

At the end of the file add:

```markdown
<footer>
  <img src="assets/logo-lite.png" width="50" style="vertical-align:middle"/>
  © 2025 Your-Org Ltd – Confidential   |   Page \\thepage
</footer>
```

Pandoc with `--template eisvogel` or `--template latex` will render this in every PDF page’s footer.

---

### 4. Final skeleton (excerpt)

```markdown
<!-- LOGO COVER -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/logo.png" alt="Your-Org Security Logo" width="180"/>
</p>

## Professional Smart-Contract Security Audit Report
*(Template & detailed guidance)*

---

### 1. Executive Summary
...
```

Replace `assets/logo.png` with your actual path; keep width ≈ 160-200 px for cover, ≤ 60 px for headers/footers.

That’s all you need—your report is now professionally branded from the first glance through every page.
